## Further development

### Remove repeated menu bar code
The menu bar code is repeated at the top of every HTML file. This is a potential maintenance headache and ideally should be in a separate file. I found descriptions of various ways to do this. However, they all required use of another techology like JavaScript or PHP. I decided it was beyond the scope of this exercise, but something I would definitely pursue on a real development.
